# What is this?

This provides some utility types that help represent uncertain outcomes. More specifically: it provides TypeScript
implementations of *result* and *option* types.

The API for these types is very closely modelled around the
`Option` and `Result` types in Rust. These Rust types are the inspiration for this library.

We also provide some helper types for dealing with options and results in asynchronous contexts. See AsyncOption and
AsyncResult for more information.
